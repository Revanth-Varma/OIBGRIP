        <br><p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system</p><br>
        <h2>Nikola Tesla Inventions:</h2>
        <p>Nikola Tesla inventions constitute numerous technological breakthroughs throughout his lifetime.Born in Smiljan, Croatia, in 1856, the math and physics genius contributed innovations that continue to impact our lives daily today. He held over three hundred patents, but was only recognized for some, indicating many of his ideas were tested and failed or never became well known.</p>
        <p>In 1882, upon graduation from the Technical University of Graz and Philosophy at the University of Prague, he drew the first sketches of his idea to build an electromagnetic motor. His first job entailed retailing DC power plants for ConEd which led to his immigration to the states in 1884.    </p>

        <h2>TESLA’S ULTIMATE DREAM: WARDENCLYFFE</h2>
        <em>Can you just imagine a long range wireless charging device that can charges your mobile, your car and any other electronic device even if you are in a place at an hundreds of kilometers from the device?</em>
        <br><em>Can you just imagine our Earth without any electrical wires/cables, but can produces electricity?</em>
        <p>Yeah, it's not a joke.It's true!</p>
        <p>It's Tesla, who first tried to give the world wireless electricity.</p>
        <img id="img2" src="Images\Wardenclyffe Tower.jpg" alt="Wardenclyffe Tower">
        <p><b>Wardenclyffe Tower</b>, the biggest dream of Tesla by which he thought to produce a long range wireless electricity. It can transmits electricity from one place to other without any physical medium required.<br>To realize this dream, Tesla sought the investment of J.P. Morgan. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (Equivalent of 4 million today) to build a wireless communications tower at the site of Wardenclyffe.</p>
        <p>Yet, according to Tesla’s lab notes, he was able to successfully power light bulbs without wires from over 200 feet away, in 1898.  It’s mind-boggling really, Tesla was knocking on the door of a historic breakthrough that still isn’t mainstream some 100 years later. It just goes to show how far ahead of his time he really was.He then requested Morgan to increase his investment over the project to make the tower a reality. But Morgan refused to increase his investment and Tesla was left on his own. He was ran out of money and support. Also the site was abandoned in 1905. Later he spent most of his remaining years in deppression and isolation.</p>
        <p>It’s impossible to tell what would of happened had J.P. Morgan continued to invest in Tesla and had his dream of Wardenclyffe realized.  Maybe it would of been a massive failure and Tesla was always destined to spend the twilight of his life in isolation, or maybe, just maybe, Tesla would of shocked the world and brought something to the mainstream 100 years ago that many people today still aren’t aware of. </p>
